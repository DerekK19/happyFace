			<string># SASlideMenu

Created by **stefanoa**

A simple library to create sliding menus that can be used in storyboards and support static cells. Sliding menus are used in a number of popular applications like Facebook, Path 2.0, GMail, Glassboard and many others.

The repository is an Xcode 4 project that contains two example of the usage of the library and the library itself.

# Usage
You can use SASlide menu with both static cells and dynamic cell prototypes. In the project yuo will find two different target that use both type of cells to create a slide menu.
To use it in your project follow these steps:

* Add the SASlideMenu subdir and his content to your project
* Add a new class that inherit from **SASlideMenuViewController** and implement **SASlideMenuDatSource** and **SASlideMenuDelegate**. **SASlideMenuDataSource** is where you will code your customization while **SASlideMenuDelegate** is where you will add your code to implement the behavior of your app related to the SASlideMenu events. There are a minimum **SASlideMenuDataSource** methods that are required while the **SASlideMenuDelegate** is entirely optional.
* Add a new **SASlideMenuRootViewController** in your storyboard
* Add a **UITableViewController** and make it of the **SASlideMenuViewController** subclass you already implemented and customize it in accordance with your needs.
* Connect the **SASlideMenuRootViewController** with your subclass with a custom segue of type **SASlideMenuLeftMenuSegue**, set the segue identifier to **leftMenu**.
* To add Content ViewController you have to to do the following:
 * Create your content view controller and embed it in a **UINavigationController**
 * Connet it to the SASlideMenuViewController via a SASlideMenuContentSegue. If you are using static cells simply connect from the corresponding cell. If you are using dynamic cell prototype connect it from the VieController and assign an identifier that will be returned in the **sugueIdForIndexPath:** method linked to the desired indexPath.
* To add a right menu, connect a new **UINavigationController** containing a **UITableViewController** to the menu view controller using a **SASlideMenuRightMenuSegue** and set the segue identifier to **rightMenu**. The new view controller will contain the right menu and will allow navigation.

Test it and you are done!
